          <h2> iPhone SE 2 Rumoured to Sport 4.2-Inch Display, Launch at WWDC 2018    </h2>
          <p>

            While not many details are available about its existence, a new report from China claims that Apple is planning to launch the iPhone SE 2 at this year's WWDC developers conference. The iPhone SE successor is also claimed to include fresh specifications, including an A10 SoC and a 4.2-inch display over the A9-powered original model that was debuted with a 4-inch IPS display. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo already suggested that the next affordable iPhone would not include 3D sensing features as well as wireless charging support, both of which were among the key highlights of the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus, though it is expected to run iOS 12 out-of-the-box.

          <h2>Honor 9 Lite Starts Receiving Face Unlock Feature via OTA Update</h2>
          <p>
            Honor lite has started receiving the advanced Face Unlock feature. Huawei brand Honor on Wednesday announced that it has started rolling out the new feature via an OTA (over-the-air) update in India that will be available to all Honor 9 Lite users by March 5. The proprietary feature was debuted on the Honor View 10 flagship in November last year.

            You can manually check for a new software update on your Honor 9 Lite to see the availability of the Face Unlock feature. To check the update, go to Settings > System updates. Since the OTA release is rolling out in batches, it could take some time to reach your device
